## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vishnu4305/smart-city-assistant.git
cd smart-city-assistant
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Credentials

The application uses Streamlit's secrets management. Create a file named `.streamlit/secrets.toml` in the root of your project directory and add your credentials in the following format:

```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[ibm]
api_key = "YOUR_IBM_WATSONX_API_KEY"
project_id = "YOUR_IBM_WATSONX_PROJECT_ID"
base_url = "https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com" # Or your specific region

[mongodb]
connection_string = "YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING"
database_name = "YOUR_DATABASE_NAME"
collection_name = "YOUR_COLLECTION_NAME"
```
**Important**: Do not commit your `secrets.toml` file to version control. The `.gitignore` file should already be configured to ignore it.

### 5. Run the Application

Once the dependencies are installed and secrets are configured, you can run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application should now be running and accessible in your web browser!
